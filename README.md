# Finite Element Method (FEM)
This project essentially implements Finite Element Method (FEM)
for arbitrary 2D surfaces.   
It can be used to carry out simulations regarding temperature of the surface.  
Given the program's output, you can tell the 
temperature of the nodepoint at given time.

The implementation includes Solidworks files parsing
so that you can easily model your object there 
and conduct simulations here.

The source code includes:
* classes representing components that make up the grid
* data structures that store crucial data to the algorithms present in code.
* functions that calculate necessary matrices and use the data structures mentioned above

This project was created for university course purposes.
